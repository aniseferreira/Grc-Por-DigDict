<b>Ancient Greek (GRC) Keyboard Layout for Mac OS X users (Beta Code + Greek TONOS acute)</b>

This is an Ancient Greek keyboard layout for Mac OS X users following the beta code transliteration since the Polytonic Greek keyboard embedded in the system is not at all user-friendly. This keyboard is a modification of the keyboard Greek Koine RD by Rod Decker[http://ntresources.com/blog/?page_id=2800]. The modification refers to the vowels with just the acute accent. Originally they have the Unicode acute OXIA accent (U+1FFD). This one has the Unicode acute Greek TONOS (Unicode U+384) according to the newest web applications such as TÃ¼ndra, and extensions such as the Greek Beta Code Converter.

The modification was done with Ukelele software.
